## Description

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why**<br>
I intend on taking this time to design a portfolio site using React. I'm hoping to get a UI/UX that's modern.

## Challenges I Anticipate

**List out the challenges you anticipate for completing this project**<br>
Self taught in Basic React
Actual information on the site instead of filler text.

## Skateboard

**ONE SINGLE aspect of product. Consider: build backend for SPD 1.2 front end, CRUD one resource, use API or library, authentication etc.**

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.**<br>
Modern One-Page UI/UX for use on a future project.

## Bike

**ONE additional features that get you closer to your idealized product. Examples: CRUD 2nd resource, add comments, API use, authentication, library use**<br>
Start developing back end in express and deploy on heroku.

## Car

**ONE additional feature**<br>
Attach to another personal project and populate the information with pertinent data.
